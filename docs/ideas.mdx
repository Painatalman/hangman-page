# Ideas

- allow people to select a word and share the game with others to guess
  - people could submit words and receive an url for that game. The game would start with that word
  - allow sharing a game you just did
    - set custom message whether you lost or won (ex.: "don't suffer alone. Share the pain with your friends")
- make the doll react to plays
  - speech balloon saying "OH NO" when there's a mistake
- add a dictionary reference to the solution after ending a game
- add a footer with contact and content info
- add a fighting game nod when someone wins without errors
  - "PERFECT!" - "FLAWLESS VICTORY"
- Add themes (like wrestling) to the game
